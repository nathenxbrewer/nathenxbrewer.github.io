### A multiplayer remake of the classic Nokia game. Survive against other snakes for as long as you can

There are different power-ups that can transform the snake. When only one snake is still alive, each player
receives a score depending on the other they died. The game finishes when one of the players reaches a score
limit.

The game can be played by up to 4 players in the same computer. Many options, such as the score limit and
the size of the game, can be defined before playing. A maximum of 6 snakes (including AI) can play on each
game.
