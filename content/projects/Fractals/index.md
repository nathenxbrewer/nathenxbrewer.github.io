### Generate fractal pictures based on complex functions and root finding algorithms

Specify a complex function and draw the fractal associated with it. Each point on the screen represents a
two-dimensional coordinate on the complex plane. The Newton's method in evaluated on every point and a color
is selected depending on the solution obtained.

Different coloring options allow to obtain a smooth, nice-looking fractal for every function. Colors also
help to determine the zones with higher convergence, and the exact location of the function roots as well.

The image can also be inverted, evolving into brighter colors as the number of iterations increases. The
Newton's coefficient of convergence can be modified to obtain rotating images.

Almost any function can be tested to provide different types of fractals, including trigonometrical
functions, divisions, exponentials and logarithms.
