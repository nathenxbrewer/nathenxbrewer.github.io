### Play, edit or export songs while you get familiar with the harmonica

Visualize different types of interactive harmonicas that will play each note when you tap the corresponding
keys.

Download songs from the online library and play, edit or export them both as a MIDI audio or as a music
sheet, with multiple settings to customise them. Display the tabs of the selected harmonica in the music
sheet for a faster learning curve.

The songs are written in the standard ABC format that is easy to understand and human-readable. The
visualization engine has been adapted from the Java project [ABCJ](http://abcj.ganderband.com).

_Note: the back-end server for this project is no longer active, and hence not all the features of the app
 below can be tested._
