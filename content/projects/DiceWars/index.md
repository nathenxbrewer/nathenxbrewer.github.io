### A remake of the original Risk-style [Flash](https://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/dice/dice.html) game with extra functionality

Select the number of players and whether they will be AI controlled or not. Each player will start in an
hexagonal map with a given amount of dice distributed randomly across his territories.

On each turn, a player can attack neighbour territories. The dice on each territory will be thrown to
determine the score. If the player succeeds, all the dice but one will move to the attacked territory. If
the player fails, all the dice but one will be lost.

At the end of each turn, each player will receive an amount of dice depending on how many connected
territories he has. The dice will be distributed randomly across all his territories.

The hexagonal grid is randomly generated by a procedural algorithm that ensures variety and fun on each
game. No game will be identical to another.
