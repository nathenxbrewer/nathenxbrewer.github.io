### Catching up with people around has never been funnier

Have you ever been trying to get in touch with someone you know by sight from your college, your working
place or from your favourite venue but you never find the right moment or way of doing it?

Are you just interested in getting to know new people?

Soulhunter allows you to catch up with new people around you avoiding any awkward situation.

The client side of this project consists on a native iOS app written predominantly in Swift. This connects
to a back-end server written in PHP and hosted in Amazon Web Services.

Previous iterations of this project included a native Android app written in Java; this was discontinued to
focus on the iOS market. To mitigate this, a port to Xamarin.Forms which will support both platforms is 
ongoing. _The app is currently unavailable until this port is completed._
